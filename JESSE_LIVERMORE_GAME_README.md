# Jesse Livermore Trading Game 🎮📉

> *"The game taught me the game. And it will never be finished."* — Jesse Livermore

A **real-world short selling simulator** using live BitMine Immersion (BMNR) stock data. Experience the mechanics of short selling with authentic brokerage terms, margin requirements, and risk management just like professional traders face.

## 💾 Game Currency: Bytes (฿)

**1 Byte (฿) = 1 USD equivalent**

This game uses **computer dollars called "bytes"** as the simulation currency. All capital, profits, losses, and fees are denominated in bytes:
- Starting Capital: ฿50,000 (equivalent to $50,000 USD)
- Position Value: ฿31,280 (1,000 shares @ $31.28)
- Margin Required: ฿46,920 (150% of position)

**Why "Bytes"?**
- Makes it clear this is a simulation with play money
- No real financial risk—practice without fear
- Learn expensive lessons cheaply
- You can "go broke" and restart immediately

*Remember: Bytes are fictional. But the mechanics are 100% real.*

## 📜 History: When Was Short Selling Created?

### Origins: **Amsterdam Stock Exchange, 1609**

Short selling is **over 400 years old**—nearly as old as stock markets themselves.

**Timeline:**
- **1602:** Dutch East India Company (VOC) becomes first publicly traded company
- **1609:** Isaac Le Maire, a disgruntled former VOC director, organizes the **first recorded short selling campaign**
  - He believed VOC shares were overvalued
  - Borrowed shares, sold them, spread negative rumors
  - Attempted to profit when price dropped
  - **Result:** Dutch government **banned short selling** (first of many bans)

**Why It Kept Coming Back:**
- Despite bans, short selling repeatedly re-emerged
- **1733:** Britain banned it after South Sea Bubble
- **1812:** Napoleon banned it in France
- **1929:** U.S. blamed shorts for Great Depression (led to uptick rule)
- **2008:** Temporary bans during financial crisis
- **Every ban failed**—shorts returned because they serve a purpose

## ⚖️ The Economic Purpose: Price Discovery & Market Balance

### The "Positive Bias" Problem

You've identified the core insight: **Markets have a structural bias toward optimism.**

**Why Markets Are Naturally Long-Biased:**

1. **Companies Want Higher Stock Prices**
   - CEOs compensated in stock options (incentive to pump)
   - Easier to raise capital when price is high
   - Prestige, ego, board pressure

2. **Analysts Have Conflicts of Interest**
   - Investment banks issue stocks → need buy ratings
   - "Buy" ratings: 70% | "Hold": 25% | "Sell": **5%**
   - Nobody wants to anger management by saying "sell"

3. **Media Rewards Bulls, Punishes Bears**
   - CNBC: "Stocks hit all-time highs!" = exciting content
   - "This company is a fraud" = lawsuit risk
   - Perma-bulls get invited back, bears get ridiculed

4. **Investors Have Psychological Long Bias**
   - Easier to imagine "prices go up forever"
   - Shorting feels "un-American" (betting against success)
   - Long = unlimited upside, short = unlimited downside (risk asymmetry)

5. **Central Banks Intervene to Prop Up Markets**
   - Fed cuts rates when stocks fall (moral hazard)
   - Quantitative easing = "Fed put" (floor under prices)
   - Governments bail out failing companies (2008, 2020)

**Result:** Without short sellers, prices become **detached from reality**.

---

### Short Sellers as "Market Police"

Short sellers perform a critical function: **finding overvalued stocks and fraud**.

#### **Famous Cases Where Shorts Exposed Reality:**

| Year | Company | What Shorts Found | Outcome |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| **2001** | **Enron** | Jim Chanos shorted, exposed accounting fraud | Bankruptcy, executives jailed |
| **2008** | **Lehman Brothers** | David Einhorn warned about toxic assets | Bankruptcy, financial crisis |
| **2015** | **Valeant Pharma** | Shorts exposed drug pricing fraud | -90% crash, CEO ousted |
| **2020** | **Wirecard** (Germany) | Shorts found €1.9B "didn't exist" | Bankruptcy, CEO arrested |
| **2020** | **Nikola Motors** | Hindenburg Research: "founder is a fraud" | Stock -90%, founder indicted |
| **2023** | **Adani Group** (India) | Hindenburg exposed $100B+ fraud | -$100B market cap in days |

**Without shorts, these frauds would have continued for years.**

### The Economic Theory: **Efficient Market Hypothesis**

**Price Discovery Requires Both Bulls AND Bears:**

```
Bull's Argument:           Bear's Argument:
"This company will grow!"  "This company is overvalued!"
         ↓                          ↓
      BUY pressure              SELL pressure
         ↓                          ↓
         └──────────────┬───────────┘
                        ↓
              TRUE MARKET PRICE
           (reflects all information)
```

**If only bulls exist:**
- Prices inflated by hype, FOMO, momentum
- No mechanism to correct overvaluation
- Bubbles form (Dotcom 2000, Housing 2008, Crypto 2021)
- Everyone loses when reality hits

**With short sellers:**
- Overvalued stocks get attacked
- Shorts do research, publish reports
- Market adjusts faster
- Frauds exposed sooner

---

### The Philosophical Debate

**Pro-Short View:** *"Shorts are truth-seekers exposing lies"*
- They risk real money betting against consensus
- Do forensic accounting, investigative journalism
- Protect retail investors from scams
- Essential for market integrity

**Anti-Short View:** *"Shorts are manipulators spreading FUD"*
- They profit from destruction (un-American)
- Spread rumors, coordinate attacks
- Can force good companies into bankruptcy (death spiral)
- 2008 financial crisis blamed on shorts attacking banks

**The Reality:** Both are true.
- Some shorts are heroes (Enron, Wirecard exposés)
- Some shorts are predators (naked shorting, bear raids)
- Regulation tries to balance both

---

### Modern Regulation: Lessons from 400 Years

**Current Rules (Post-2008):**

1. **Uptick Rule (Rule 201):**
   - Can't short a stock on continuous downticks
   - Prevents "bear raids" (coordinated attacks)
   - Triggers when stock drops 10% in a day

2. **Disclosure Requirements (13F filings):**
   - Large shorts must be disclosed publicly
   - Prevents secret manipulation
   - But also warns companies they're being targeted

3. **Naked Short Selling Ban (2008):**
   - Must **locate shares** before shorting
   - Can't sell shares that don't exist
   - Stops phantom supply dilution

4. **Circuit Breakers:**
   - Trading halts on extreme volatility
   - Gives market time to process information
   - Prevents flash crashes

**The Balance:**
- Shorts are allowed (price discovery)
- But regulated (prevent abuse)
- 400 years of experimentation → current system

---

## 🤝 The Invisible Hand: Is This System "Adam Smith-Like"?

**Yes—with important caveats.** Short selling is a near-perfect example of spontaneous order creating public benefit from private greed.

### Adam Smith's Core Insight (1776):

> *"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest."*

**Translation:** People pursuing profit accidentally create social good without intending to.

### Short Selling as Invisible Hand Mechanism

**The Paradox:**
- Short seller's motive: **Selfish greed** (make money from price decline)
- Short seller's action: **Research, expose fraud, challenge overvaluation**
- Societal benefit: **Price discovery, market efficiency, fraud detection**

**Nobody plans this. It emerges from incentive structure.**

```
Individual Level:           System Level:
─────────────────          ─────────────
"I smell fraud!"      →    Market becomes more honest
"I can profit!"       →    Prices reflect reality
"Let me prove it!"    →    Frauds exposed faster
"I'll short this!"    →    Bubbles deflate sooner

Private Greed = Public Good
```

### The Mechanism Works Because:

#### 1. **Aligned Incentives (No Central Planner Needed)**

Unlike regulators who *should* find fraud but face bureaucracy:
- **SEC:** Underfunded, slow, political pressure, revolving door with Wall Street
- **Auditors:** Paid by companies they audit (conflict of interest)
- **Credit Raters:** Paid by issuers (see 2008 AAA-rated junk)

Short sellers have **skin in the game**:
- Wrong? → Lose their own money (brutal feedback)
- Right? → Profit millions (massive reward)
- No bureaucracy, no committees, no politics
- Pure economic incentive drives truth-seeking

#### 2. **Distributed Knowledge (Hayek's Insight)**

F.A. Hayek (1945): *"The knowledge of particular circumstances of time and place"* is dispersed.

Short sellers aggregate diverse information:
- Ex-employees know internal problems
- Competitors know weaknesses
- Forensic accountants spot fraud patterns
- Supply chain analysts see inventory issues

**No central authority could gather all this.** Short sellers mobilize distributed knowledge through profit motive.

#### 3. **Self-Correcting Without Intervention**

When shorts are wrong:
- Stock goes up → Shorts lose money → Forced to cover → Stock goes up more
- Bad shorts get wiped out (natural selection)
- Only disciplined shorts survive

When shorts are right:
- Stock falls → Longs exit → Price corrects to reality
- Capital reallocated to productive uses
- Market becomes more efficient

**No regulator needed to decide who's right.** The market votes with money.

#### 4. **Competition Creates Quality**

Multiple short sellers compete to find the best opportunities:
- Race to expose fraud first (publish research reports)
- Better analysis = more profit
- Sloppy research = losses

This competition improves quality of price discovery, just as competition among bakers improves bread quality.

### Where the Invisible Hand FAILS: The Caveats

#### ⚠️ **Problem 1: Manipulative Shorts (Bear Raids)**

**The Dark Side:**
- Short seller spreads *false* rumors
- Coordinates with others to panic market
- Profits from destruction of *healthy* company
- 1929: Pools of shorts attacked solvent banks (amplified Great Depression)

**Invisible hand failure:** Private profit ≠ public good when actor cheats.

**Solution:** Regulation (uptick rule, anti-manipulation laws, disclosure)

#### ⚠️ **Problem 2: Death Spirals**

**The Feedback Loop:**
1. Shorts attack struggling company
2. Stock falls → Credit rating downgraded
3. Can't refinance debt → Bankruptcy risk rises
4. More shorts pile on → Stock crashes
5. Company actually goes bankrupt (might have survived)

**Invisible hand failure:** Self-fulfilling prophecy destroys value.

**Solution:** Circuit breakers, uptick rules, temporary short bans

#### ⚠️ **Problem 3: Negative Externalities**

**When Short Attacks Succeed:**
- Employees lose jobs (company bankrupts)
- Customers lose products/services
- Communities lose tax revenue

**Shorts capture profit but don't bear social costs.**

**Invisible hand failure:** Profit ≠ total social welfare.

**Solution:** Bankruptcy laws, unemployment insurance (mitigate damage)

---

### The Synthesis: Spontaneous Order + Necessary Guardrails

**Pure Adam Smith Invisible Hand?** No—requires regulation.

**Pure Central Planning?** No—regulators can't match distributed knowledge.

**Actual System:** **Hybrid**
- **Let shorts operate freely** (harness invisible hand)
- **But with rules** (prevent manipulation, death spirals, naked shorting)
- 400 years of iteration found this balance

### The Deeper Pattern: Formal Systems Thinking

This connects to your project's thesis:

> *"Structure determines solvability. Formal foundations before claims."*

**The Structure of Short Selling:**
- Incentive structure: Profit from exposing overvaluation
- Information structure: Distributed knowledge mobilized by price signals
- Feedback structure: Wrong bets → losses → natural selection
- Constraint structure: Margin requirements → risk limits

**This structure emerges from:**
- Property rights (can borrow/lend shares)
- Contract law (enforceable agreements)
- Price signals (profit/loss mechanism)
- No central designer planned it

**But it only works with formal foundations:**
- Clear rules (uptick rule, locate requirement)
- Enforcement (SEC, exchanges)
- Transparency (disclosure, reporting)

**Result:** A system where:
- Private greed → public good (invisible hand)
- But rules prevent chaos (visible regulation)
- Emergent order from simple rules (complexity science)

---

### Adam Smith Himself on Speculation

Interestingly, Adam Smith (1776) *was skeptical of speculators*:

> *"The trade of a speculator...is generally reckoned disadvantageous to the society."*

**But modern economics proved him wrong on this specific point:**
- Speculators (including shorts) improve price discovery
- They add liquidity (easier to trade)
- They absorb risk from producers/hedgers
- Smith didn't foresee informational value of speculation

**The irony:** Smith's invisible hand works better than even he realized—but only with rules he didn't anticipate needing.

---

### Bottom Line: A Sophisticated Invisible Hand

**Yes, short selling is Adam Smith-like, but evolved:**

| Pure Invisible Hand | Short Selling Reality |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| No regulation needed | Requires guardrails (uptick rule, disclosure) |
| Self-interest always = social good | Sometimes creates death spirals |
| Market self-corrects instantly | Needs circuit breakers for panics |
| Spontaneous order sufficient | Spontaneous order + formal rules |

**It's an invisible hand with a visible referee.**

The system demonstrates that:
- **Markets are smarter than any individual** (distributed knowledge)
- **But markets need rules to function** (formal foundations)
- **Structure determines behavior** (incentives drive truth-seeking)
- **Emergence requires constraints** (freedom within boundaries)

This is exactly your thesis: **"Structure determines solvability."**

The structure of short selling (profit from exposing overvaluation + margin limits + transparency rules) creates an emergent property (market efficiency) that no central planner could achieve.

It's one of capitalism's most elegant mechanisms—and most controversial. 🤝⚖️

## 🎯 What is Short Selling?

Short selling is betting that a stock price will **go down**:

1. **Borrow** shares from your broker
2. **Sell** them immediately at current market price
3. **Wait** for price to drop
4. **Buy back** shares at lower price
5. **Return** shares to broker
6. **Keep** the difference as profit

**Example:**
- Borrow 1,000 shares at $30 → Sell for ฿30,000
- Price drops to $25 → Buy back for ฿25,000
- Return shares → Profit: ฿5,000 (minus fees)

**But if price goes UP:**
- Borrow 1,000 shares at $30 → Sell for ฿30,000
- Price rises to $40 → Buy back for ฿40,000
- Return shares → **Loss: ฿10,000** (plus fees)

## 🏦 The House: Your Brokerage

### Who Is "The House"?

**The House** represents your brokerage firm (like Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, etc.). They act as:

1. **Share Locator** - Finds shares available to borrow
2. **Lender** - Lends you the shares for shorting
3. **Risk Manager** - Monitors your margin and liquidates if necessary
4. **Fee Collector** - Charges borrow fees and commissions

### Where Do Borrowed Shares Come From?

The broker locates shares from three main sources:

#### 1. **Their Own Inventory**
- The brokerage holds shares in their own account
- Easiest to locate, lowest borrow fees

#### 2. **Other Clients' Margin Accounts** (Most Common)
- When you open a margin account, the fine print allows the broker to lend your shares
- Client A holds 10,000 BMNR shares long
- Broker lends those shares to Client B for shorting
- Client A usually doesn't know and still sees their shares in the account
- If Client A tries to sell, broker must "recall" shares from Client B

#### 3. **Institutional Share Lending Programs**
- Pension funds, mutual funds, ETFs lend shares to earn extra income
- Broker borrows from these institutions and re-lends to you
- Higher fees for "hard-to-borrow" stocks

---

## 💵 Why Would Anyone Lend Their Shares?

### The Incentive: **Passive Income from Stock Lending Fees**

If you own shares long-term, lending them generates "free money" with minimal risk.

### How the Economics Work:

**Example: You own 10,000 BMNR shares @ $30 = $300,000 position**

#### **Revenue Split:**
| Party | Gets | Amount (8% borrow fee) |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| **You (Share Owner)** | 50-70% of fee | **$12,000 - $16,800/year** |
| **Broker (Middleman)** | 30-50% of fee | $7,200 - $12,000/year |
| **Short Seller** | Pays | -$24,000/year (8% × $300k) |

*Note: Split varies by broker and account type. Institutional lenders often negotiate 60-80% of the fee.*

### Why Lenders Do It:

#### 1. **"Free Money" on Holdings You're Keeping Anyway**
- You're bullish on BMNR and holding for 5+ years
- Your shares sit idle → Earn **$12k-$16k/year** lending them
- Annual return boost: **4-5.6%** on top of any price appreciation
- It's like collecting rent on a house you're not selling

#### 2. **Zero Opportunity Cost** (for long-term holders)
- Shares are instantly recalled when you want to sell
- You still see them in your account
- You still get dividends (if any)
- You still have voting rights (in theory—complex in practice)
- The only "cost" is a few hours delay if broker needs to recall

#### 3. **Institutions Have Fiduciary Duty to Maximize Returns**
- **Pension funds:** Must generate returns for retirees
- **Mutual funds/ETFs:** Compete on performance metrics
- **University endowments:** Need income for operations
- NOT lending shares when there's demand = leaving money on table
- Boards/regulators expect them to participate in lending programs

#### 4. **Broker Incentivizes It** (for retail clients)
- Some brokers share lending fees with retail accounts:
  - **Interactive Brokers:** Stock Yield Enhancement Program (50% split)
  - **Fidelity:** Fully Paid Lending (pays up to 70%)
  - **Schwab:** Securities Lending (varies)
- Many retail clients opt-in without realizing
- Margin account agreements often auto-enroll you

#### 5. **Risk is Low (Usually)**
- Broker guarantees you get shares back
- If short seller defaults, broker covers
- Your shares are marked "on loan" but insured by broker
- Only real risk: **Short squeeze** where broker can't recall fast enough

---

### Real-World Example: GameStop (GME) Short Squeeze

**Before Squeeze (2020):**
- GME trading at $4-$20
- 140% of float was shorted (more shares shorted than exist!)
- Borrow fee: **20-30% annually**
- Share lenders earning: **$6-$9 per share per year** on $30 stock = 20-30% income!
- Institutional lenders making millions in fees

**During Squeeze (January 2021):**
- GME spikes to $483
- Short sellers desperate to cover
- Borrow fee spikes to **200%+ annually** (briefly)
- Lenders making **$200/share/year** in fees (stock at $300 = 66% annual return just from lending!)
- Brokers couldn't locate shares → **Recalls everywhere**

**The Catch:**
- Some lenders who tried to sell during squeeze found:
  - Shares were "on loan" and couldn't be recalled fast enough
  - Missed selling at $483, got filled at $120 (75% loss vs peak)
  - This is the **ONLY** real risk of lending shares

---

### Why Brokers Love Share Lending:

**It's Pure Profit:**
1. Broker collects 8% from short seller: **$24,000/year**
2. Broker pays you 50%: **-$12,000/year**
3. **Broker keeps 50%: $12,000/year profit** (for doing almost nothing)

**Scaled Up:**
- If broker facilitates $1 billion in short positions
- At 8% borrow fee = $80 million annual revenue
- Broker keeps 40% = **$32 million profit**
- No capital required—they're just the middleman

This is why brokers **automatically enroll** margin accounts in lending programs.

---

### The Fine Print (What You Agree To):

When you open a **margin account**, you sign away rights:

> *"Securities held in your margin account may be loaned to other clients or broker-dealers. We may lend your securities without notice to you. While your securities are on loan, you will not be able to exercise voting rights."*

**Translation:**
- Your 10,000 BMNR shares can be lent to short sellers
- You might miss voting in shareholder meetings
- During extreme volatility (short squeeze), recall might be delayed
- But you get paid lending fees (if broker shares them)

**Cash Accounts:** Shares CANNOT be lent without explicit opt-in.

---

### Bottom Line: Why Do Lenders Expose Their Shares?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **💰 Passive Income** | Earn 4-8% annually on holdings you're keeping anyway |
| **📈 Fiduciary Duty** | Institutions legally required to maximize returns |
| **🏦 Broker Incentives** | Automated enrollment + revenue sharing |
| **⚖️ Low Risk** | Broker guarantees return of shares (usually) |
| **🎯 Rational Greed** | If someone wants to pay you rent on your stock, why not? |

**The Gamble:** Long holders bet that:
- Stock will go up (their thesis)
- Short sellers will lose money
- They can recall shares if needed to sell
- Lending fees > risk of not being able to sell at optimal moment

**In a normal market, this works great. In a short squeeze, it's chaos.** 🎢

### How Many Shares Are Available?

**In Real Markets:**
- **Total Float:** BMNR has ~100M shares outstanding (example)
- **Shares Available to Short:** Varies by broker availability
  - **Easy to Borrow:** 30-50% of float available (low fees, 1-2% annual)
  - **Hard to Borrow:** 5-15% of float available (high fees, 8-20% annual)
  - **No Locate:** 0% available (impossible to short, shares recalled)

**Share Availability Changes Based On:**
- How many clients hold BMNR long in margin accounts
- How many traders are already short (competition for shares)
- Recent price action (after a squeeze, shares harder to find)
- Institutional lending (pension funds can withdraw shares anytime)

**In This Game:**
- We simulate BMNR as a **"hard-to-borrow"** stock
- Borrow fee: **8% annually** (realistic for low-float, high-volatility stocks)
- Assumption: Your broker has located shares for your position
- **Risk:** Shares can be "recalled" if lender wants them back (not implemented yet, but realistic)

## 💰 Real-World Brokerage Terms

### 1. **Initial Margin Requirement: 150%** (SEC Regulation T)

To short ฿10,000 worth of stock, you must post ฿15,000 in your account.

**Why?**
- You owe the ฿10,000 in shares you borrowed
- Plus 50% buffer (฿5,000) in case price rises
- The House protects itself from your potential losses

**Example:**
- Short 1,000 shares @ $30 = ฿30,000 position
- Required margin: ฿30,000 × 1.5 = **฿45,000 needed**

### 2. **Maintenance Margin: 125%**

Your equity must stay above 125% of the current position value.

**Margin Call Trigger:**
- If BMNR rises and your equity drops below 125%, you get a **margin call**
- The House demands you deposit more cash immediately
- If you don't, they liquidate your position

**Formula:**
```
Equity = Net Capital + Unrealized P&L - Borrow Fees
Margin Level = Equity / Current Position Value

If Margin Level < 125% → MARGIN CALL
```

### 3. **Liquidation Threshold: 110%**

If your margin drops to 110%, the House **automatically closes your position** without warning.

**This is brutal but realistic:**
- House doesn't wait for you to respond
- They liquidate at market (might get terrible price)
- You eat the loss, no exceptions

### 4. **Borrow Fees: 8% Annually**

Borrowing shares isn't free. You pay rent to the share lender.

**Daily Cost:**
- 8% annual = 0.022% daily (8% / 365)
- On ฿10,000 position: **฿2.19 per day**
- On ฿50,000 position: **฿10.96 per day**

**These fees accrue every day** you hold the position, including weekends and holidays.

### 5. **Commission: 0.5% per Trade**

You pay commission when you open AND close the position.

**Example:**
- Open: Short ฿30,000 → Commission ฿150 (0.5%)
- Close: Cover ฿27,000 → Commission ฿135 (0.5%)
- Total commissions: ฿285

## ⚠️ Risk Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Profitable Short
```
Entry: 1000 shares @ $32.00 = ฿32,000
Exit:  1000 shares @ $25.00 = ฿25,000
Hold: 5 days

Gross P&L: ฿7,000 profit
- Opening Commission: -฿160
- Closing Commission: -฿125  
- Borrow Fees (5 days): -฿35.07
- Net P&L: +฿6,679.93 ✅

Jesse would be proud! 🎉
```

### Scenario 2: Margin Call
```
Entry: 1000 shares @ $30.00 = ฿30,000
Capital: ฿50,000
Margin Level: 166% ✅ HEALTHY

Price rises to $38.00:
Current Value: ฿38,000
Unrealized Loss: -฿8,000
Equity: ฿50,000 - ฿8,000 = ฿42,000
Margin Level: ฿42,000 / ฿38,000 = 110% ⚠️

🚨 MARGIN CALL! House watching closely...
```

### Scenario 3: Forced Liquidation
```
Entry: 1000 shares @ $30.00 = ฿30,000
Capital: ฿50,000

Price rises to $40.00:
Current Value: ฿40,000
Unrealized Loss: -฿10,000
Equity: ฿50,000 - ฿10,000 = ฿40,000
Margin Level: ฿40,000 / ฿40,000 = 100% 💥

Below 110% threshold → LIQUIDATION
House closes position WITHOUT NOTICE
You lost ฿10,000+ (including fees)
Game over. Brutal but realistic.
```

**Jesse Lauriston Livermore (1877-1940)**

- One of the most famous traders in history
- Made $100 million shorting before the **1929 stock market crash** (worth ~$1.7B today)
- Known as the "Great Bear of Wall Street"
- Made and lost several fortunes throughout his career
- Popularized tape reading and technical analysis
- His book *"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"* (1923) is still required reading for traders

**His Famous Trades:**
- 1907 Panic: Made $3 million shorting (J.P. Morgan personally asked him to stop)
- 1929 Crash: Made $100 million in one day shorting the market
- Final Years: Lost most of his fortune in bad trades during the 1930s

## 🔗 Integration with BitMine Tracker

This game uses live BMNR data from your tracker at:
- **Repository:** https://github.com/tjpools/BIT
- **Live Site:** https://tjpools.github.io/BIT/

The price feed comes from `fetch_and_generate.py` which pulls real-time Yahoo Finance data with:
- Rate limiting (exponential backoff)
- Data validation (corruption detection)
- Structured logging

## 💡 Philosophy

> *"Structure determines solvability. Formal foundations before claims."*

This game applies rigorous principles to market mechanics:

- **No hand-waving:** Real margin math, real fees, real liquidation
- **Brutally accurate:** The House doesn't care about your feelings
- **Educational:** Learn through doing (and losing)
- **Respectful:** Jesse Livermore lost fortunes too—risk is real

## 🎯 Ready to Play?

```bash
# Start a short position
python jesse_livermore_game.py open 1000 50000

# Check your position (do this often!)
python jesse_livermore_game.py check

# Close when ready (or get liquidated...)
python jesse_livermore_game.py close
```

**Remember:** The House always wins on fees. Your edge must overcome:
- 8% annual borrow cost
- 1% total commissions (open + close)
- Margin requirements tying up capital
- Time decay eating your equity daily

*Good luck. You'll need it.* 🎲
